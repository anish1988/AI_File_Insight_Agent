# This is a simple file insight agent that uses the Gemini API to analyze files and provide insights.
# The code uses Streamlit for the web interface and pandas for data manipulation.
# The agent can handle .txt, .log, and .csv files.
# The code includes a file uploader, file preview, and a placeholder for AI insights.
# The AI insights section is currently a placeholder and can be implemented with the desired AI processing logic.
# The code also includes error handling for file reading and unsupported file types.
# The agent is designed to be user-friendly and provides a simple interface for users to upload files and view insights.
# The code is structured to be easily extendable for future enhancements and additional features.
